<h2> My Synopsis</h2>

<p>	After Criminal Mastermind Artemis Fowl's last run-in with the fairies, he's had his mind wiped about their existence. Without knowing anything about the fairy world Artemis must stop it from crashing with the human world. Worst of all Artemis might be facing off against someone who can fool even him.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Main Characters</h2>

<h3>Artemis Fowl</h3>

<p>	Artemis is unfathomably smart, and everyone is relying on him to remember everything that got wiped from his mind from his last encounter with the fairies. And this time there's the equally intelligent Opal Koboi to have to deal with now too!
</p>

<h3>Opal Koboi</h3>

<p>	Such an intelligent fairy that she has outsmarted the likes of Foaly on multiple occasions, she stands a threat to the fairy and human worlds with her seemingly flawless plan. Will Artemis be able to put a stop to the plan of Opal Koboi, whose wit may be even greater than his own?
</p>

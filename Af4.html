<h2>My Synopsis</h2>

<p>	After Criminal Mastermind Artemis Fowl's last run-in with the fairies, he's had his mind wiped about their existence. Without knowing anything about the fairy world Artemis must stop it from crashing with the human world. Worst of all Artemis might be facing off against someone who can fool even him.

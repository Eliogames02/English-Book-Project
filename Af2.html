<h2>My Synopsis</h2>

<p>	Young Criminal Mastermind Artemis Fowl tries his best to rescue his pronounced dead and kidnapped father from the grasp of the Russian Mafia. He can't accomplish this alone and now finds himself asking his recent foe Captain Short to lend him some of her fairy magic.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Main Characters</h2>

<h3>Artemis Fowl</h3>

<p>	Artemis is so brilliant, he has a pretty solid plan as to how he will save his long-since-kidnapped father from the Russian Mafia. He puts a bit too much reliance on the outside help of the fairy people including the assistance of Foaly, who is constantly challenging Artemis's intellect.
</p>

<h3>Foaly</h3>

<p>	Foaly is a Centaur engineer and a smarts guy. He's the best techy guy the LEP has. If it wasn't for him, many things that Artemis and Holly try to do wouldn't be possible, especially seeing as he makes many gadgets for Captain Short and provides Artemis and Holly with information and surveillance.

<h2>My Synopsis</h2>

<p>	Criminal Mastermind Artemis Fowl has new competition as they race to reach a lost colony of the People that's been strangely separated from the rest. With the help of Holly, Foaly, Mulch, and a new friend, Artemis and Butler launch a plan to sabotage their competition. Through various endeavors, Artemis, Holly Short, and their newfound friend travel through space and time and end up stuck with a bomb and one too many aggressive residents of this lost colony.
